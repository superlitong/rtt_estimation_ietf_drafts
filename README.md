Reducing the number of ACKs is essential in scenarios where ACK overhead is non-negligible.  However, a lower ACK frequency can introduce biases in delay estimation, such as overestimating the minimum round-trip time (minRTT).  This document proposes how to calibrate the estimation of the minRTT under low ACK frequency conditions.
